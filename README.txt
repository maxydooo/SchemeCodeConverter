Overview: For this project I have created a program that takes in code and functions from the Scheme language and converts it into valid and properly functioning C++ code. This project utilized Project 2 which was a Syntactic Analyzer for Scheme code.

For my Project 3, I was able to get tests 1-7 working with correct output after being ran. One of the things I wasnt able to get working in some test cases
but not all was the __RetVal = lines. In test cases 8 and 9 I was able to get everything except the __RetVal = lines. In my test A I have a working main but
the rest I was missing a few things. As for the total test cases I have 48/64 working.

Work Still Under Development: This project doesnt work 100% of the time and I believe the following work still needs to be done:
- Thoroughly test everything as well as clean up possible past mistakes
- Add flags to help with verification errors
- Add better and more accurate formatting logic
